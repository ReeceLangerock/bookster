Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play received its world premiere in London’s West End on 30th July 2016. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.",

Sirius Black, escaped mass-murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort is on the run – and they say he is coming after Harry. In his first ever Divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves … But perhaps most terrifying of all are the Dementors patrolling the school grounds, with their soul-sucking Kiss … This gift edition hardback, presented in a beautiful foiled slipcase decorated with brand new line art by Jonny Duddle, will delight readers as the plot thickens and the dangers multiply in Harry's third year at Hogwarts.",

In the book you now hold in your hands (or for more advanced students, the book you have levitated into a suitable position while you feed snacks to your owl), seventeen philosophical scholars unlock some of Hogwarts secret panels, displaying fresh insights enlightening both for sorcerers and for the more discerning Muggles. Among the occult lore here revealed, behold the best recipe for true courage, proof that self-deception does not yield happiness, how ethics can be applied to the branch of technology known as magic, why the Mirror of Erised isn't adequate for real life, whether prophecy rules out free choice, and what dementors and boggarts can teach us about joy, fear, and the soul. All the pages of this book are acid-free and have been individually bewitched with an anti-befuddlement incantation. Dont forget to keep your wand primed and read between the lines. Failure to observe these precautions may invite the malign influence of Vol sorry, He Who Must Not Be Named. ''Harry Potter and Philosophy is the most enjoyable HP spin-off Ive read and Ive read most of them. Some chapters are so full of good reflections, clear thinking, and reliable scholarship, I couldnt resist reading entire passages aloud. Our family plans to read these thought-provoking essays at the dinner table, sparking intelligent conversation with our teen- and college-aged children Harry Potter fans all.''",

Rowling's work from a broad range of perspectives within literature, folklore, psychology, sociology, and popular culture. A significant portion of the book explores the Harry Potter series' literary ancestors, including magic and fantasy works by Ursula K. LeGuin, Monica Furlong, Jill Murphy, and others, as well as previous works about the British boarding school experience. Other chapters explore the moral and ethical dimensions of Harry's world, including objections to the series raised within some religious circles. In her new epilogue, Lana A. Whited brings this volume up to date by covering Rowling's latest book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.",
